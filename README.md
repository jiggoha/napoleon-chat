# napoleon-chat
Chat component of Napoleon game that will hopefully expand to the whole thing.

DONE:
* Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
* Add support for nicknames
* When new users are added, they will see the most recent messages from before they joined

TODO:
* Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
* Add “{user} is typing” functionality
* Show who’s online
* Add private messaging
