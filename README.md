# napoleon-chat
Chat component of Napoleon game that will hopefully expand to the whole thing.

TODOs from the Socket.IO website:
* ~~Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects~~
* ~~Add support for nicknames~~
* Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
* Add “{user} is typing” functionality
* Show who’s online
* Add private messaging
